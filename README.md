# Discrete Mathematics Specialization Coursera

This repo is for documenting my progress for the Coursera Discrete Math Specialization.
[Discrete Mathematics Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics)

This course contains 5 courses and I would be doing all of them step by step and adding them when completed.
##### But! Please don't blindly copy the solution's as the notion of online learning disappears and it is also against the academic policy of coursera.
